# ⚡ SwiftPC-Booster

**SwiftPC-Booster** is a lightweight Windows batch utility designed to reclaim disk space and improve system responsiveness by deleting temporary files and cached data and emptying the Recycle Bin.

> 🧹 One-click cleanup for safe and effiecient system maintenace.

---

## 🚀 Features

SwiftPC-Booster performs the following operations:
- Deletes temporary files from:
  - `%TEMP%` (user temp folder)
  - `C:\Windows\Temp`
- Clears old prefetch data from `C:\Windows\Prefetch`
- Empties the Recycle Bin via PowerShell
- Automatically requests Administrator privileges
- Provides clear status output for each operation

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Administrator access is required** to modify system folders.  
  The script will automatically prompt for elevation if needed.
- **Deleting Prefetch data is optional** — it is *not* necessary for performance.  
  Windows automatically manages Prefetch to speed up app loading; the script clears it only if you choose to.
- The cleanup operations are safe, but **use at your own risk**.  
  Always ensure you understand what’s being deleted before automating this.
